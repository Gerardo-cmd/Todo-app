# Todo-app
The user can add todos and remove them as they wish. There are checkboxes next to each todo that the user can check to signify if it is completed or not. At the top of the website one can find a search bar that will filter the todos based on what the user types in by looking for a matching title. The user will also be told how many todos are left based on how many unfinished (unchecked) todos exist. There is also an option to only display the incompleted todos.

Here is the link for the website!
